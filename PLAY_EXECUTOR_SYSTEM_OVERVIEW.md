# üé≠ Play Executor System Overview

## Introduction

The **Play Executor System** is a sophisticated autonomous trading system that understands natural language trading plays, executes complex strategies, and intelligently intervenes when market conditions change. It goes beyond simple stop-loss orders to provide comprehensive play management with real-time monitoring, adaptation, and intervention capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **PlayExecutorAgent** (`agents/play_executor.py`)
   - Natural language play parsing
   - Complex execution planning
   - Intelligent monitoring and intervention
   - Performance tracking and adaptation

2. **Central Reporting System** (`core/play_reporting.py`)
   - SQLite database for all play data
   - Comprehensive logging of actions, interventions, and outcomes
   - Historical analysis and statistics

3. **FastAPI Backend Integration** (`backend/api/fastapi_app.py`)
   - RESTful endpoints for play management
   - Real-time WebSocket broadcasting
   - Integration with existing trading system

4. **React Frontend** (`frontend/src/pages/PlayExecutor.tsx`)
   - Real-time play monitoring dashboard
   - Natural language play creation interface
   - Detailed play analysis and intervention history

## üß† Natural Language Play Parsing

### How It Works

The system can understand complex trading plays written in natural language:

```python
# Example natural language play
play_description = """
Buy NVDA on momentum breakout above $500 with strong volume confirmation. 
Target $550, stop loss at $480. This is a short-term momentum play based on 
AI chip demand surge.
"""
```

### Parsing Process

1. **LLM Analysis** (when OpenAI is available):
   - Extracts side (buy/sell), timeframe, priority, tags
   - Identifies entry/exit strategies, catalysts, risks
   - Generates structured play object

2. **Heuristic Fallback**:
   - Keyword-based parsing for side detection
   - Timeframe extraction from natural language
   - Tag generation based on play characteristics

### Parsed Output

```json
{
  "title": "NVDA Momentum Breakout Play",
  "side": "buy",
  "timeframe": "Short-term",
  "priority": 8,
  "tags": ["momentum", "breakout", "NVDA", "AI"],
  "entry_strategy": "Buy on momentum breakout above $500...",
  "exit_strategy": "Target $550, stop loss at $480...",
  "catalysts": ["AI chip demand surge"],
  "risks": ["Market volatility", "Technical breakdown"]
}
```

## üéØ Intelligent Play Execution

### Execution Phases

1. **Entry Phase**
   - Creates structured order with SWOT analysis
   - Sets up monitoring conditions
   - Establishes risk parameters

2. **Monitoring Phase**
   - Real-time performance tracking
   - Market condition analysis
   - Intervention trigger detection

3. **Exit Phase**
   - Automatic exit based on criteria
   - Manual intervention support
   - Performance analysis and reporting

### Monitoring Conditions

```python
monitoring_conditions = {
    "price_monitoring": {
        "track_entry_price": True,
        "track_high_low": True,
        "alert_thresholds": {
            "profit_target": 0.10,  # 10% profit
            "stop_loss": 0.05,      # 5% loss
            "momentum_threshold": 0.03  # 3% move
        }
    },
    "volume_monitoring": {
        "track_volume_trend": True,
        "alert_thresholds": {
            "volume_drop": 0.5,     # 50% volume drop
            "volume_spike": 2.0     # 200% volume spike
        }
    },
    "news_monitoring": {
        "track_sentiment": True,
        "alert_thresholds": {
            "negative_sentiment": -0.5,
            "positive_sentiment": 0.5
        }
    }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Intelligent Intervention System

### Intervention Types

1. **Stop Loss Hit** - Automatic position exit
2. **Take Profit Hit** - Target reached, secure profits
3. **Timeout** - Play duration exceeded
4. **Market Condition Change** - Adverse market movement
5. **Volume Anomaly** - Unusual trading volume
6. **News Impact** - Significant news affecting position
7. **Technical Breakdown** - Support/resistance violations
8. **Correlation Breakdown** - Expected correlations fail

### Intervention Logic

```python
def _check_for_intervention(self, play, order, market_data):
    # Check stop loss
    if current_price <= stop_loss_price:
        return {
            "type": InterventionType.STOP_LOSS_HIT,
            "reason": f"Price {current_price} hit stop loss {stop_loss_price}",
            "action": "exit_position"
        }
    
    # Check max drawdown
    if max_drawdown > 15%:
        return {
            "type": InterventionType.MARKET_CONDITION_CHANGE,
            "reason": f"Max drawdown {max_drawdown:.1%} exceeded threshold",
            "action": "reduce_position"
        }
    
    # Check volume anomaly
    if volume < 50% of average:
        return {
            "type": InterventionType.VOLUME_ANOMALY,
            "reason": f"Volume significantly below average",
            "action": "monitor_closely"
        }
```

### Adaptation System

The system can also adapt plays based on market conditions:

- **Positive Momentum**: Add to position when profit > 5%
- **Negative Momentum**: Reduce position when loss > 3%
- **Volume Confirmation**: Adjust based on volume trends
- **News Sentiment**: Adapt based on market sentiment

## üîÑ Integration with Existing System

### Enhanced Trade Executor

The Play Executor integrates with the existing structured order system:

```python
# Creates structured order with full analysis
order = enhanced_trade_executor.create_structured_trade(
    symbol=symbol,
    side=parsed_play["side"],
    quantity=initial_quantity,
    market_data=market_data,
    news_data=news_data,
    play_title=parsed_play["title"],
    play_description=parsed_play["description"],
    confidence_score=confidence_score,
    priority=parsed_play.get("priority", 5),
    tags=parsed_play.get("tags", []),
    notes=parsed_play.get("notes", "")
)
```

### Meta-Agent Integration

The system reports to the central monitoring system for meta-agent oversight:

- All play actions are logged to the monitoring database
- Meta-agent can access play statistics and performance
- Integration with governance and reporting systems

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Creating a Play

```python
# Via API
response = await api.post('/api/plays/create', {
    "play_description": "Buy AAPL on earnings momentum. Strong fundamentals suggest 10% upside. Stop loss at 5% below entry.",
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "initial_quantity": 10,
    "confidence_score": 0.8
})

# Via Python
play = play_executor.create_play_from_natural_language(
    play_description="Buy AAPL on earnings momentum...",
    symbol="AAPL",
    initial_quantity=10,
    market_data=market_data,
    news_data=news_data,
    confidence_score=0.8
)
```

### Monitoring a Play

```python
# Monitor with current market data
result = play_executor.monitor_and_execute_play(
    play_id="play_20250710_142549",
    current_market_data={
        "price": 157.5,
        "change_pct": 5.0,
        "volume": 1200000,
        "avg_volume": 1000000
    }
)

# Check for interventions
if result["status"] == "intervention_executed":
    intervention = result["intervention"]
    print(f"Intervention: {intervention['reason']}")
```

### Manual Intervention

```python
# Via API
response = await api.post('/api/plays/play_20250710_142549/manual-intervention', {
