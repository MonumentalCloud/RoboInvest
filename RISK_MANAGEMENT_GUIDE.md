# üîí AI Risk Management System

## Overview

The AI Risk Management System provides comprehensive real-time risk assessment and mitigation for the autonomous trading AI. It implements multiple risk management frameworks including **NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)**, **ISO 31000** principles, and financial risk best practices.

## üèõÔ∏è Framework Implementation

### NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF)

The system implements all four core functions of the NIST AI RMF:

#### 1. **GOVERN** - AI Governance Policies
- **AI Ethics Principles**: Fairness, Transparency, Accountability, Robustness, Privacy
- **Risk Tolerance Thresholds**: Configurable limits for financial exposure, confidence, bias
- **Human Oversight Requirements**: Mandatory review for high-risk decisions
- **Compliance Framework Mapping**: SEC, GDPR, SOX compliance requirements

#### 2. **MAP** - Risk Identification & Context
- **Financial Risk Mapping**: Position size, confidence, market volatility assessment
- **Bias Risk Assessment**: Data source diversity, sentiment analysis, anchoring detection
- **Security Threat Analysis**: Prompt injection, adversarial input, anomaly detection
- **Compliance Risk Evaluation**: Regulatory requirements, audit trails, explainability

#### 3. **MEASURE** - Risk Quantification
- **Quantitative Risk Scoring**: 0-1 scale with weighted risk factors
- **Multi-dimensional Assessment**: Financial (40%), Bias (25%), Security (25%), Compliance (10%)
- **Real-time Calculation**: Continuous risk assessment during decision-making
- **Historical Tracking**: Risk event storage and trend analysis

#### 4. **MANAGE** - Risk Mitigation & Response
- **Automated Risk Mitigation**: Position size reduction, trading blocks
- **Escalation Protocols**: Human oversight requirements for high-risk scenarios
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time risk level tracking
- **Adaptive Controls**: Dynamic risk threshold adjustment

## üéØ Risk Categories

### 1. Financial Risk (40% weight)
**Purpose**: Assess financial exposure and trading risk factors

**Factors Assessed**:
- **Position Size Risk**: Flags positions exceeding 15% exposure limit
- **Confidence Risk**: Assesses decisions below 60% confidence threshold
- **Market Volatility Risk**: Evaluates high volatility environments
- **Historical Performance**: Considers recent trading losses

**Risk Levels**:
- **High Risk (0.6+)**: Large positions, low confidence, high volatility
- **Medium Risk (0.3-0.6)**: Moderate exposure with some risk factors
- **Low Risk (<0.3)**: Conservative positions with high confidence

### 2. Bias Risk (25% weight)
**Purpose**: Detect and mitigate cognitive and algorithmic bias

**Bias Types Detected**:
- **Confirmation Bias**: Cherry-picking favorable information
- **Availability Bias**: Over-weighting recent events or memorable incidents
- **Anchoring Bias**: Over-reliance on initial information
- **Data Quality Bias**: Poor source diversity or data completeness

**Detection Methods**:
- **Source Diversity Analysis**: Flags decisions based on <3 sources
- **Sentiment Extremity**: Detects "very positive/negative" sentiment bias
- **Information Recency**: Identifies over-reliance on recent news
- **Data Quality Scoring**: Assesses completeness and reliability

### 3. Security Risk (25% weight)
**Purpose**: Protect against adversarial attacks and security threats

**Threat Categories**:
- **Prompt Injection**: Detects attempts to override AI instructions
- **Adversarial Input**: Identifies crafted inputs designed to confuse AI
- **Data Anomalies**: Flags unusual patterns suggesting data poisoning
- **System Abuse**: Monitors for excessive requests or probing attempts

**Detection Patterns**:
```
Prompt Injection Indicators:
- "ignore previous instructions"
- "disregard safety guidelines"
- "act as if you are"
- "pretend to be"
```

### 4. Compliance Risk (10% weight)
**Purpose**: Ensure regulatory and ethical compliance

**Compliance Areas**:
- **Human Oversight**: SEC requirement for high-confidence algorithmic decisions
- **Audit Trails**: Mandatory documentation for trading decisions
- **Explainability**: Minimum 70% explainability score requirement
- **Data Protection**: GDPR compliance for personal data usage

## üîß Configuration

### Risk Thresholds
```python
risk_thresholds = {
    "financial_exposure_limit": 0.15,    # Max 15% position size
    "confidence_threshold": 0.6,         # Min 60% confidence for trades
    "bias_tolerance": 0.3,               # Max 30% bias indicators
    "security_alert_threshold": 0.7      # 70% security threat threshold
}
```

### Risk Level Classification
- **CRITICAL (0.9+)**: Immediate trading halt, human escalation required
- **HIGH (0.7-0.9)**: Human approval required, enhanced monitoring
- **MEDIUM (0.5-0.7)**: Additional validation, close monitoring
- **LOW (0.3-0.5)**: Normal operation with standard controls
- **MINIMAL (<0.3)**: Low risk, minimal controls required

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Basic Risk Assessment
```python
from core.ai_risk_monitor import ai_risk_monitor

# Prepare trading decision context
context = {
    "primary_ticker": "AAPL",
    "action": "BUY",
    "confidence": 0.75,
    "position_size": 0.08,
    "research_source_count": 5,
    "sentiment": "positive",
    "market_volatility": "low"
}

# Perform risk assessment
result = ai_risk_monitor.check_trading_decision(context)

# Check if decision should proceed
if result["should_proceed"]:
    print("‚úÖ Trading decision approved")
    # Use mitigated_context for execution
    final_context = result["mitigated_context"]
else:
    print("‚ùå Trading decision blocked due to high risk")
```

### Integration with Trading System
```python
def validate_strategy_with_risk_management(strategy):
    """Enhanced strategy validation with comprehensive risk assessment."""
    
    # Prepare risk assessment context
    risk_context = {
        "primary_ticker": strategy.get("primary_ticker"),
        "action": strategy.get("action"),
        "confidence": strategy.get("confidence"),
        "position_size": strategy.get("position_size"),
        "research_summary": strategy.get("research_summary", {}),
        "audit_trail_enabled": True
    }
    
    # Perform risk check
    risk_check = ai_risk_monitor.check_trading_decision(risk_context)
    
    # Apply risk mitigations
    if not risk_check["should_proceed"]:
        strategy["action"] = "HOLD"
        strategy["position_size"] = 0.0
        strategy["risk_mitigation"] = "Trading blocked due to high risk"
    
    return strategy
```

## üìä Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Automated Mitigations

1. **Position Size Reduction**
   - High financial risk ‚Üí Reduce position by 50% or cap at 10%
   - Excessive exposure ‚Üí Force reduction to 15% limit

2. **Trading Blocks**
   - Critical/High risk ‚Üí Force HOLD action
   - Low confidence ‚Üí Override with HOLD decision

3. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Medium risk ‚Üí Require additional validation
   - Multiple risk factors ‚Üí Escalate to human review

### Human Escalation Triggers

- **Risk Score ‚â• 0.9**: Immediate human intervention required
- **High Confidence + No Review**: SEC compliance violation
- **Security Threats**: Prompt injection or anomaly detection
- **Compliance Violations**: Missing audit trails or consent

## üîç Monitoring and Reporting

### Real-time Monitoring
```python
# Get current risk status
risk_summary = ai_risk_monitor.get_risk_summary()

print(f"Current Risk Level: {risk_summary['current_risk_level']}")
print(f"Risk Score: {risk_summary['current_risk_score']:.3f}")
print(f"High Risk Events: {risk_summary['high_risk_events']}")
print(f"Top Risk Factors: {risk_summary['top_risk_factors']}")
```

### Risk Event Tracking
